Create an app called food. There will be two views called 'menu' and 'contact'.
The menu view will have a url 'our-menu/', the contact view will have a url 'contact-us/'.
Make sure the food app has a urls.py file that will have the 2 urls above.
Then include the food/urls.py in the general config/urls file.

the user should go to 127.0.0.1:8000/item7/our-menu to get to the menu view
the user should go to 127.0.0.1:8000/item7/contact-us to get to the contact view
